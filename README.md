# android_server

This application is coming soon. 
The principle goal of this application is to transfer SMS from a sender to a server which will treat the data and send it back to the server to return it to the sender.
Using SMS the sender can sign, subscribe to an event or remove the event. 
This application will also list every event that has been send by the user. 
The server will also advise the sender when an event is coming soon.
